# Hyyti채l채 Forest Station DMPS & APS Data Analysis (2010-2022)

Project Overview
This project involves the collection, processing, and analysis of aerosol particle size distribution data from the Hyyti채l채 Forest Station. The dataset includes Differential Mobility Particle Sizer (DMPS) and Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) measurements spanning a 10-year period (2010-2022). The objective is to extract, clean, and analyze this data to observe seasonal and yearly trends, as well as to combine DMPS and APS data for a comprehensive particle size distribution (PSD) analysis.
